# PyBench
Easy python benchmarking.\
Do you need to compare computers/servers for python hosting or different versions of python? This tool will be perfect for you!

This tool generates a random image, a graph, and 100,000,000 digits of Pi to gauge the computing speed of the computer to give you a score and compare it.

## Usage
1. Make sure to have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "install python here") installed
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python PyBench.py`

### Note
The file "NUMWORKS-PyBench_operations-only.py" is a version compatible with Numworks calculators and provides equal scores as other versions, despite having fewer operations to perform.
